GSL shell offers an interactive command-line interface that gives
access to GSL collection of mathematical functions. GSL shell is based
on the powerful and elegant scripting language Lua.

GSL shell is not just a wrapper over the C API of GSL but does offer
much more simple and expressive way to use GSL. The objective of GSL
shell is to give the user the power of easily access GSL functions
without having to write a complete C application.

GSL Shell is based on LuaJIT2.
