If GSL Shell exists is thanks to the many high quality free software projects on which it is based.

The GSL team have made a great works over the years to bring an excellent, well thought, library for C programmers.
Their work is even more remarkable thanks to the complete and accurate documentation.
The GSL library deserves the merit of having opened the way to access high quality numerical routines for the non specialists of FORTRAN.

Many thanks also to the Lua community for publishing their work under a free software license and to Maxim Shemarev for his great AGG library.

Finally I would like to thanks to my wife, Gosia, for her patience and her support.
