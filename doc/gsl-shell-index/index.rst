The GSL Shell Project
#####################

GSL shell is an interactive command line interface that gives easy access
to the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) collection of mathematical methods for
numerical computations.

GSL shell can be used interactively to perform calculations with matrices or
vectors but it does allow also to write complex user defined functions based on the Lua programming language.

Lua is a very interesting and easy to learn scripting language that features advanced functionalities like closures and metamethods.
Lua is very easy to learn and will give you the power of defining your own complex routines to use the GSL library more easily.

GSL Shell is hosted at `Savannah <http://savannah.nongnu.org>`_, here is the `project page <https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/gsl-shell/>`_. GSL Shell comes with a complete `user manual <http://www.nongnu.org/gsl-shell/doc/>`_.

You can download the latest release of GSL Shell in the :ref:`download section <downloads>`.
You will find the source code and the binary packages for Windows and Linux.

GSL Shell comes with a quite complete `user manual <http://www.nongnu.org/gsl-shell/doc/>`_.
If you want to learn more about GSL Shell you can read with the `introduction to GSL Shell <http://www.nongnu.org/gsl-shell/doc/intro.html>`_.
You may also give a look to the `examples section <http://www.nongnu.org/gsl-shell/doc/examples.html>`_ to get a feeling of GSL Shell.

.. note::
   The manual GSL Shell 1.1 is still `available here <http://www.nongnu.org/gsl-shell/doc-v1/>`_.
