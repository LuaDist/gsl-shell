Interpolation
=============

This chapter describes functions for performing interpolation.  The
library provides a variety of interpolation methods, including Cubic
splines and Akima splines.  The interpolation types are interchangeable,
allowing different methods to be used without recompiling.
Interpolations can be defined for both normal and periodic boundary
conditions.
